2. Request Parameters:

The Hotel Shopping  API takes the following request parameters

&dest=specifies a geographical anchor point for the hotel deal search.   Results will include neighborhoods in the city most closely matching the parameter.

You may specify a lat,lon pair.
You may specify a string that we can geocode into a lat,lon pair.   You can try addresses, city names, and points of interest.  
You may specify a 3 letter airport code, such as LAX or JFK
Be aware that the API will proceed with a "best match" for ambiguous destinations, so developers should attempt to resolve ambiguous inputs before calling the API.
If the specified location does not match a city where Hotwire has inventory, the API will return results in the closest city where inventory is available.
If no Hotwire inventory is available within 200 miles of the specified destination, in any direction, then the API will return no results..
Examples:
&dest=Seattle
&dest=Portland,OR
&dest=LAX
&dest==37.792,-122.397
&dest= is a required parameter.

&startdate=&enddate specifies stay dates for the hotel search.

Examples:
&startdate=07/04/2010&enddate=07/11/2010  #specific checkin and checkout dates
&startdate- and &enddate= are required parameters
 

&rooms=  specifies the number of rooms to search for

4. Response XML:

XML Responses to the Hotel Shopping API are divided into five sections.

A <MetaData> section, containing descriptions of items that may be referenced repeatedly in results.  Use of the metadata section results in a more manageable message size for large result sets.
A <Result> section, containing descriptions of individual priced hotel  results.
A <StatusCode> numeric, which will be 0 for successful calls.
A <StatusDesc> textual element, which will be ‘success’ on successful call and contain diagnostic information otherwise.
An <Errors> section containing detailed information describing errors for unsuccessful calls.
MetaData contains the following data:

<Amenities>describing features of the hotel offering, such as swimming pools, restaurants, or spas.  Consists of <Amenity> records, each of which contains:
<Code> a two character code to be referenced in the Results section of the response.
<Description> a textural description, suitable for display.
<Neighborhoods> describing the geography in which a Hotwire hotel offering is located.  Remember, Hotwire doesn’t disclose the precise identify or location of specific hotels until after a purchase is confirmed.  Consists of multiple <Neighborhood> records, each of which contains,
<Centroid>  a comma separated list of two numeric values representing latitude and longitude
<City> <State> and <Country> The city state and country in which the Neighborhood is located.
<Id> a numeric Neighborhood id, to be referenced in the Result section of the response.
<Name> The neighborhood’s name as it appears on Hotwire.com.

<StarRating> The Hotwire Star Rating of the result.  May be between 1 and 5 stars, in 0.5 star increments.
Additionally, if the incoming request includes a "&linkshareid=" parameter with a valid 11 character value, then the resulting HotelDeal records will include a LinkshareDeepLink  data element.   Traffic from Hotwire affilates must come through these Linkshare comatible URLs in order for the affiliate to receive credit for resulting transactions.

Note that it is permissible to cache Hotwire neighborhood and amenity data to avoid parsing the metadata with each response.
